### Easy and Secure

Most things that increase security make your life a little harder. Locks, for
example, are just so tedious to deal with. The only exception to this rule that
I've encounteres is a password manager. What's that? Oh, you don't know? Allow
me to give a sales pitch.

Passwords are such a bore, amirite? Too long, not long enough, needs more
cowbell. The umpteenth iteration of my dogs name is hard to remember. "Is it
sparky22 or sparky21 on facebook...?" If you're anything like me, you're about
2 incorrect attempts away from launching a brick through your own window because
you can't remember that password you use once a year for TurboTax.

Calm down, dear friend! The end of your struggles is nigh. Let me show you the
ways of a password manager. With this wonderful tool, of
[which](https://www.lastpass.com/) [there](https://keepersecurity.com/)
[are](https://1password.com/) [many](https://www.stickypassword.com/), you will
only have to remember one password. Just one!

I know what you're going to say: "but Erik, having just one password is a single
point of failure. That contradicts a fundamental tenet of any secure system!"

You're a keen bean, dear friend, but you're missing the point. One strong point
of failure is much better than many weak points of failure. Whether it's some
clever phone scammer gleaning information from you, or some script kiddie
running executables they found on 4chan, your self-generated password is
probably pretty weak. Just take a look at the [most common
passwords](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/22/uk/most-common-passwords-scli-gbr-intl/index.html).
The point is that weak passwords will get you PWNed.

"Okay," you might respond, "but I'm no dummy. No system is unbreakable, and
vault of a bajillion passwords is the holy grail for a malicious user. Why would
I put my precious password in that vault?"

Ah, I see your distrust runs as deep as my own. You are right to scorn all
commercial attempts at increasing security. Let's take a look at our options
here.

### Locals Only

I use [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) because it keeps my passwords on my
local machine, and off of some [service that could, and probably will, get
hacked](https://security.harvard.edu/faq/what-if-lastpass-gets-hacked). What's
more secure about my local machine than, say, LastPass' server? Probably
nothing, but that's beside the point. We are not trying to build the most
secure, unbreakable system here; we are simply trying to not be the lowest
hanging fruit.

There are probably other options for locally managed password stores, but the
point of this post is not to compare and contrast them all. The point of this
post is to show you that a little bit of work up front will make yuor password
life way easier. Have a better solution than Pass? Send an email to blog [at]
this domain and I'd be happy to hear about it.

### GPG? PGP? WTF? IDFC!

Calm down, there's no need to curse. Some alphabet soup follows, so take a deep
breath and don't worry if you can't remember everything in this section.

Pass uses GPG to encrypt and decrypt passwords. What's encryption? Well, uh,
that's a big questions. Just read this [wikipedia article](), I'm not here to
lecture. What is GPG? Its GNU's
implementation of PGP, of course.
