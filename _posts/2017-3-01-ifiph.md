# Journey Within
Mindfulness-based empowerment expert Arda Ozdemir designed a mobile application,
Journey Within, which was predicated on the notion that self-reflection is the
best tool for tranquility and healing

# App Flow
The application lead user's to a guided meditation that was suited for their
particular situation. User's would state how they are feeling and what they are
struggling with in order to arrive at the meditation recording. The fundamental
concept here was to invoke self-reflection for the user as they moved through
the application.

# Development
I was tasked with designing and building out the back end. The rest API served
JSON data to the iOS client via HTTP. The tricky part of the development process
was streamlining data manipulation for the client.
