# Chops as a Software Engineer
Working at CODE was fast paced, but calculated. Small team size forced all of
us to wear many hats and work quickly, while the high volume of patient data
stressed tight security and strict compliance.

Developing alongside just a few individuals had me interacting with all parts
of the software stack on a daily basis, not to mention the continuous
integration process. Being the first among a group of new-hires granted me
invaluable experience in helping mitigate the growing pains of a small business.

Towards the end of my time at CODE I was working heavily in dev-ops, maintaining
a robust suite of in-house tools (primarily Ansible playbooks, bash scripts, and
python scripts) left over from the co-founder. This honed my skills with AWS and
deepened my knowledge of linux systems.

I walked away from CODE with strong back end development skills in Java,
proficiency with AWS networks in general, and the ability to live and breathe in
the Ubuntu command line.

# More About the Company Collecting Patient Reported Outcomes is crucial for
evidence based medicine, but it is to arduous a task for doctors, nurses, and
clinicians to do themselves.  CODE collects outcomes directly from the patient,
effectively delivering the data and analytics that doctors need without
disturbing their day-to-day work.  Check out the awesome work CODE does on
[their website](https://www.codetechnology.com/).
