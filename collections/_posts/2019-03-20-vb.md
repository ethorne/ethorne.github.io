### What are vim sessions?

Don't be a script kiddie: read the docs! Open vim and type
```
:h session
```
The long and short of it is this: sessions are vim's way of saving workspace
state. This means buffers, windows, tabs, registers, recent locations, etc.

Sessions are pretty cool, but they are too tedious to work with. This is why I
downloaded [tpope's](https://tpo.pe/)
[Obsession](https://github.com/tpope/vim-obsession). This makes working with
sessions a lot easier! Once invoked, the plugin saves the session every time you
do something that might change it (like open a window, close a buffer, etc.).
This is much nicer that the out-of-the-box functionality, but even interacting
with Obsession was too much work.

### Using Obsession to replicate modern IDE functionality

I use vim because I want to pick and choose functionality of modern IDEs. This
allows me to get all the productivity benefits associated with such fancy pieces
of software, without all the useless bloat. In this example, I want to

- quit vim
- restart my computer (or whatever)
- then pick up right where I left off with a single command

I handled this with a bit of Bash. 

```
export vim_sessions=$HOME/.config/vim

_vim_sessions(){
    local cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
    COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "$(ls ${vim_sessions})" -- $cur) )
}

complete -F _vim_sessions vs

vs(){
    # open vim and source session Session.vim or parameter1.vim

    mkdir -p ${vim_sessions}

    # use Session.vim if no param given
    if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
        SESSION_NAME=session
    else
        SESSION_NAME=$1
    fi

    SESSION_PATH=${vim_sessions}/$SESSION_NAME

    if [[ ! -f $SESSION_PATH ]]; then
        # make session file if it does not exist
        vim -c "Obsession $SESSION_PATH"
    else
        # source session file if it exists
        vim -S $SESSION_PATH
    fi
}
```

What's going on here...

- the `vim_sessions` variable is an absolute path to the location where the
  session files are stored.
- the `_vim_sessions` and the `complete` command after that are the bash
  completion magic
- the `vs` function is the meat and potatoes! This open vim with a session
  tracked by Obsession, making a new one if needed.

Most of the time I'm writing code in a git repository and I have a certain files
open and arranged for a task as hand. Wouldn't it be great if I could source a
session for just this branch? It would, and it is! Take a look:

```
vb(){
    # open vim and source session for curent git branch
    # used for creating / writing source code
    # if anything is given for first param
    #   session will be deleted and recreated (start fresh)

    repo=$(basename `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
    branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

    if [[ -z $branch || -z $repo  ]]; then
        return 0
    fi
    mkdir -p ${vim_sessions}/$repo
    path_segment=$repo/$branch.vim

    if [[ $1 ]]; then
        rm ${vim_sessions}/$path_segment
    fi

    vs $path_segment
}

```

This command takes an argument, usually I give it `-` but it can be literally
anything. If the argument is present, the session for that branch is deleted and
created anew.

If you find these useful, head over to my
[dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ethorne/dotfiles) and check out the
`bash_aliases` file. There might be some other stuff in there you dig.
