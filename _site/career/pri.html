    <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>I lead a team of engineers to develop a plugin for Medium Editor to be used by
the writers and editors of Public Radio International. I also designed the
structure of the plugin and lead development team in the implementation of it.</p>

<h1 id="development">Development</h1>
<p>The plugin was essentially a modal window that would launch within the editor
and allow insertion of stylized media types. JQuery was the primary language
used for development. The plugin allowed writers and editors to create content
for PRI in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get manner. This entailed interaction with
social media APIâ€™s as well as other media sources like Vimeo or YouTube.</p>
