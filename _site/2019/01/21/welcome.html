<p>Hello friend! I’m glad you stumbled across my tiny site.</p>

<p>My name is Erik and I have way more things that I want to accomplish than I have
time to accomplish them. Whatever though, thats a lame excuse for inaction.</p>

<p>For now this site exists primarily as an online
<a href="http://localhost:4000/2019/01/01/resume.html">résumé</a>, but there’s so much more to come!</p>

<p>I’m interested in getting more involved in network security and what that even
means. So as I explore that world I’ll make sure to post things that I have done
that are interesting.</p>

<p>The things you can most expect on this site in the near future are posts about
my <a href="https://github.com/ethorne/dotfiles">dotfiles repository</a>. I have a lot of
stuff on there that I think is pretty clever (/brushesoffshoulder), and I’d love
to share it with whatever nerd wants to listen. Now I just have to find the
time to write all that…</p>

<h1 id="what-keeps-me-busy">What keeps me busy</h1>
<h2 id="computers">Computers</h2>

<p>I love cooking up my own solutions with whatever tools I have at my disposal.
Sometimes its a “I wonder how hard this would be” kind of thought, and other
times its a “I could do that so much better” thought. I run Ubuntu 18.04 as my
personal OS, I stream my music off a plex library which I have hosted off a
frankenserver at my apartment, and I’ve got a million-and-a-half
questionably-finished projects with Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms. Wanna
work on something together? Toss me a line, I’d at least like to chat about it.</p>

<h2 id="biking">Biking</h2>
<p>Since I was a kid I’ve always loved biking. I never did it on any kind of team,
or really in any organized manner, but I started building and working on bikes
with my brothers around the time I was in junior-high.</p>

<p>This summer I found myself in between jobs with a chunk of change, a friend
willing to sublet my apartment, and an irresistible urge to bike day-in and
day-out for as long as I reasonably could. I never studied abroad in College and
I always told myself that I would travel after graduating. This seemed like the
perfect opportunity, and those don’t always come around twice! I headed out of
New York City at the beginning of June. Fifteen days later I was in Chicago!</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/_img/et_bike_chicago.jpg" alt="knoxville" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>After hanging out for a bit with some friends, I took a Greyhound bus to
Knoxville, TN where this lovely picture of me was shot:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/_img/et_bike_knoxville.jpg" alt="knoxville" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Then I headed down a less-than-straightforward path to St. Augustine, FL where I
met up with some family to relax after what ended up being ~2,000 miles of
biking.</p>

<p>I could fill a whole site about the adventures I had along the way, and I could
write even more about what I learned, but no one wants to hear about all that.
It was mostly just pedalling and eating as much food as I fit in my stomach.
There was the occassional life changing moment, but no one wants to hear about
all that, right?</p>

<h2 id="climbing">Climbing</h2>

<p>I’ve been climbing rocks for almost as long as I’ve been biking, but I have way
less impressive things to share. Here’s a shot of me being a grease-ball in the
City of Rocks, ID.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/_img/et_city_of_rocks.jpg" alt="knoxville" class="center-image" /></p>

<h2 id="sewing">Sewing</h2>

<p>There will be much more to come on this. Suffice to say I do not like buying new
things if I think I can make them. The number of things that fall into that
category is increasing each year! Someday I would love to make all my own
clothes (at least the casual-wear ones) and all my own bike bags.</p>
