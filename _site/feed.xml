        <title>CODE Technology</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;chops-as-a-software-engineer&quot;&gt;Chops as a Software Engineer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at CODE was fast paced, but highly calculated. Small team size forced
all of us to wear many hats and work quickly, while the high volume of patient
data stressed tight security and strict compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing alongside just a few individuals had me interacting with all parts
of the software stack on a daily basis, not to mention the continuous
integration process. Being the first among a group of new-hires granted me
invaluable experience in helping mitigate the growing pains of a small business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most notable project at CODE had me touching nearly all parts of the code
base in a large scale refactor of our data model. The creation of scope of work
and plan of action took me nearly a month by itself! In the end I bolstered my
knowledge of design patterns and gained indispensible experience with the myriad
challenges that a refactor of that scale entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of my time at CODE I was working heavily in dev-ops, maintaining
a robust suite of in-house tools (primarily Ansible playbooks, bash scripts, and
python scripts) left over from the co-founder. At the time that I inherited this
responsiblity I understood just enough about that stack to operate in the
environment. As soon as I had to begin troubleshooting, which is an
inevitability, I realized I was in over my head. That is the exact environment I
thrive in! Before I knew it I was fixing broken deployement processes and even
augmenting them, making them easier to work with or more fault tolerant. I
conquered the feeling of being overwhelmed, honed my skills with AWS, and
deepened my knowledge of linux systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked away from CODE with strong back end development skills in Java,
general proficiency with AWS networks, and the ability to live and breathe in
the Ubuntu command line. More importantly, I now feel a high level of comfort
being responsible for vast amounts of sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting Patient Reported Outcomes is crucial for evidence based medicine, but
it is too arduous a task for doctors, nurses, and clinicians to do themselves.
CODE collects outcomes directly from the patient, effectively delivering the
data and analytics that doctors need without disturbing their day-to-day work.

        <title>Institute for Inner Peace and Harmony</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;journey-within&quot;&gt;Journey Within&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness-based empowerment expert Arda Ozdemir designed a mobile application,
Journey Within, which was predicated on the notion that self-reflection is the
best tool for tranquility and healing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;app-flow&quot;&gt;App Flow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application lead user’s to a guided meditation that was suited for their
particular situation. User’s would state how they are feeling and what they are
struggling with in order to arrive at the meditation recording. The fundamental
concept here was to invoke self-reflection for the user as they moved through
the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was tasked with designing and building out the back end. The rest API served
JSON data to the iOS client via HTTP. The tricky part of the development process
was streamlining data manipulation for the client.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Public Radio International</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lead a team of engineers to develop a plugin for Medium Editor to be used by
the writers and editors of Public Radio International. I also designed the
structure of the plugin and lead development team in the implementation of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin was essentially a modal window that would launch within the editor
and allow insertion of stylized media types. JQuery was the primary language
used for development. The plugin allowed writers and editors to create content
for PRI in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get manner. This entailed interaction with
social media API’s as well as other media sources like Vimeo or YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DatStat</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-budding-software-developer&quot;&gt;A Budding Software Developer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my entry into the world of professional software development. I got a
job at DatStat by convincing the good people there that I’m a quick learner!
They made me put my money where my mouth was with a project-based interview.
That project was my first exposure to SQL databases, MVC architecture, and C#
(which I don’t care for too much these days, more on that later). I rose to the
challenge and had a great time doing so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I had pretty bad &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&quot;&gt;imposter
syndrome&lt;/a&gt; working at DatStat,
being the youngest person in the office and only having taken two computer
science classes (one of which was in highschool almost 4 years prior). These
fears were regularly quelled my boss each time we did performance reviews.
Inbetween reviews the fear kept me vigilant. I kept a list of “stuff you don’t
know that you should know,” containing tools, phrases, concepts, or anything
that I would hear around the office and not know. (These days I keep this list
for all projects, calling it SYDKBYSK). Each night I would study the items on
the list with the little time I had between homework and the million other
things that I tried do while in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to apply the concepts I learned in school directly to my work at
DatStat was a tremendous way to cement them in my mind and also learn their
significance in the industry. Before long I found that my coding proficiency and
my ability to contextualize the theoretical world of academia with the practical
world of software development exceeded most of my classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;work-and-experience&quot;&gt;Work and Experience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at DatStat had me building out custom reports for various clients, as
well as integrating their hardware and/ or software with our platform. I also
saw the company build two products from the ground up in an attempt to replace
an existing product providing invaluable experience from an architectural and
business standpoint. Later in my time there we underwent a massive operations
overhaul. Seeing our internal process restructured and fine tuning that process
was similarly educational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DatStat’s software stack was mostly Microsoft-based (which I do not prefer these
days, but I’m no hater). The more important lessons learned from working there
were higher level: how to architecture practical software, how to navigate
legacy code, how to triage issues, and how to allocate time among the
constituents of a software development team.&lt;/p&gt;
